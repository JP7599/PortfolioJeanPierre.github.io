            <h3>Future-oriented organisation</h3>
            <p> In all group projects I have participated in, we achieved efficient task division and consistently met our internal deadlines, 
                demonstrating my ability to work effectively in team environments. However, I recognize the need for personal growth in the 
                areas of organization and time management. Currently, my schedule is somewhat irregular, with some days involving non-stop 
                work for extended hours and others requiring minimal effort. I am actively seeking to improve this aspect of my professional 
                approach, with a focus on achieving a more balanced and structured schedule in preparation for the upcoming semester
            </p>

            <div class="week2">
                <h3>Personal leadership</h3>
                <p>As the leader of my team during the orientation phase project, I spearheaded the product design and actively
                     contributed to various aspects, including coding. One of the most challenging yet crucial aspects of this role was
                      conflict resolution. Often, team dynamics are tested when a member either makes errors or fails to meet deadlines, 
                      leading to potential conflicts. It was imperative to strike a balance between holding team members accountable and 
                      ensuring that their morale wasn't adversely affected by criticism or mistakes.
                      <br>

                    In a contrasting experience during the media project, I assumed a more collaborative role. While I primarily executed
                     assigned tasks, I also contributed by offering ideas, albeit on a smaller scale. This experience provided me with 
                     valuable insight into different team dynamics and the importance of adaptability in varying roles.

            <div class="week3">
                <h3> Investigative problem solving</h3>
                <p>In my approach to both individual and group projects, extensive research forms a critical part of my process.
                     This involves exploring a variety of sources to gather ideas for color schemes, layout designs, and creative 
                     inspiration. Additionally, I constantly look solutions to overcome challenges encountered during coding. 
                     This  research not only helps to always find how to surpas those creative and technical 
                     mind blocks.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="week4">
                <h3>Targeted interaction</h3>
                <P>In my capacity as both a team leader and an active member across various projects, 
                    I have consistently demonstrated a keen understanding of the nuanced perspectives and essential requirements 
                    of direct stakeholders. This involves not only understanding the explicit needs of the project itself but 
                    also acknowledging the diverse viewpoints and contributions of each team member. My approach has always 
                    been to foster an environment where open communication and mutual respect are king.</P>
