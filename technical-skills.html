        <p>¨Capacity to develop and implement interactive prototypes in an iterative process for the target users based on
            trends and developments.¨</p>

            <h3>Trends and Developments</h3>
            <p> I used Artificial Intelligence to generate the images for my portfolio website,
                as well as researching how to use GSAP in JavaScript to generate various effects like the parallax
                 for the images and the title animation animation.
                and even though i did not use many media queries because making the horizontal scrolling was difficult, i tried to
                use ¨vmin¨ instead of ¨px¨ to keep it interactive in some parts.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="week2">
                <h3>Iterative process</h3>
                <p>This Portfolio is proof enough of an iterative process, since its complete design changed a total of four times.
                    From one that didnt represent me, to the wave design in which i was stuck for a while, with my mind closed on making it work.
                    In the end thanks to an idea from one of my teachers i got to decide this cool design which i like very much.
                    The portfolio is a representation of how i am and what i like but it also has input from many teachers and friends.
                <br>
                    The group project also used sticky notes for feedback</p>
            </div>
            <div class="week3">
                <h3> Interactive prototypes</h3>
                <p>We created many interactive prototypes this semester, i made 2 for my portfolio, the prototype i did for the Luigis Pizzeria project on the orientation phase was 
                    interactive, we also did many interactive prototypes on paper for this semester such as paper wireframes, and designing 
                    a interesting power up for a mario video game.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="week4">
                <h3>Target group</h3>
                <P>The categories on the Unicooks group project were based on information from the needs and wants from various uni students collected
                from surveys and interviews.</P>
